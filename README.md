Welcome to the Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Project repository! In this project, we utilize machine learning technology to address the challenge of predicting hotel booking cancellations, which can lead to operational inconvenience and financial losses in the competitive hospitality industry. By leveraging Jupyter Notebook, Python, and Excel, we aim to enhance the industry's value proposition by providing accurate predictions and actionable insights.

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of future hotel booking cancellations. By analyzing relevant trends and features, our developed models will efficiently identify high-risk bookings for potential cancellation. Utilizing tools such as Jupyter Notebook and Python, coupled with Excel for data analysis, we will empower hotels to proactively manage and mitigate revenue losses. This predictive approach enhances demand forecasting, refines overbooking and cancellation policies, and informs strategic pricing and inventory allocation decisions. Moreover, the analysis enables the identification of loyal customers, enabling tailored loyalty benefits for those who consistently uphold their reservations.

## Problem Statement

In the fiercely competitive landscape of the hospitality industry, the prevalence of high cancellation rates, particularly in the context of no-deposit bookings, presents a significant challenge, causing both operational inconvenience and substantial financial losses for hotels. To tackle this pressing issue, this project takes a proactive stance by harnessing the power of machine learning. By developing predictive models, the project endeavors to accurately anticipate booking cancellations and subsequently propose effective strategies to mitigate the potential revenue repercussions. This predictive approach not only contributes to refining the industry's operational efficiency but also enhances its overall value proposition, enabling hotels to pre-emptively manage cancellations and optimize revenue streams.
